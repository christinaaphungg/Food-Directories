Form hierarchical directories with Node.js


To get started:

Make sure you have Node.js downloaded. You can check that Node.js has been installed correctly by running node -v in the terminal.

Run the command start when you are ready to CREATE/DELETE/MOVE/LIST directories.

You will be prompted "Please enter command: " where you can enter CREATE/DELETE/MOVE to add, delete, or update directories (this is case sensitive). You will then be prompted "Please enter directory: " where you can enter the name of a directory you would like to create, delete, or move. If you would like to enter a subdirectory to an already existing directory, please include a '/' between the directory and the subdirectory (ex. cars/wheels).

You also have the option to enter LIST when prompted "Please enter command: " if you would like to list all directories available.
